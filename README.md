# MiViKePa
Mini Virtual KeyPad - a simple, yet effective script that doubles as a passcode protection module for Python programs
 
 ~

To run the program, make sure Python 3.0 or above is installed, then double click the .py file.

To view and change the passcode, simply edit the contents of "code.txt".

'var.txt' contains the active variables and is not supposed to be read. If deleted, simply replace it with a blank text file called 'var.txt'.
This will not affect how the program functions unless edited/deleted while it is running.

For best results, please don't run these programs from within IDLE!
